This is a placeholder website (structure) for my potential professional portfolio! Also the homework for week 2 of the Bootcamp /w Carleton University!

So far I have added 4 main pages:
 - Bio
 - Examples of Work
 - Twitch
 - Contacts

 I have still not been able to get my twitch video to work however, so I will need to keep researching until I find a solution!
